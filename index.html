        <p>
          Hi there, I'm Mat. I am a Full Stack Developer with a passion for good
          practices in everything I do. I prefer working with HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript. However it's much more likely that I'm executing test
          suites, reviewing source code and debugging broken tests, responding
          to emails and notifications via Slack and Asana, scheduling Zoom
          meetings or am in a Zoom Meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love helping others and providing value where I can. I would love to
          join a small team as a Web Developer, and collaborate on the design
          and development of web applications.

          A shell script to assist with conventional commits
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          If you've worked with me personally you probably already know I am a
          big fan of good practices in development. I do what I can to create
          consistency and predictability. Throughout 2020 I've grown
          increasingly fond of
          <a
            href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/"
            target="_blank"
            >Conventional Commits</a
          >
          since stumbling across them in
          <a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/" target="_blank"
            >Facebook's Open Source project Docusaurus</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I'm not here to convince anyone to do anything so I will let you
          decide for yourself if conventional commits are right for you. All I
          will say is that they do come in handy, but even tasks as trivial as
          commits can become flawed. Here's some issue’s I've ran into
          throughout my experience with Conventional Commits across teams:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Syntax can be tedious to remember</li>
          <li>Someone forgets or neglects the commit type</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          and this is exactly what I've aimed to fix with the
          <a href="https://github.com/hi-matbub/conventional-commit-helper"
            >conventional-commit-helper</a
          >. Assisting with the standard that comes with Conventional Commits,
          conventional-commit-helper is for consistency. The default shell
          command is established for micro commits, establish the alias and your
          on the road. For the full setup guide, head over to the docs below.

          Bootstrap a serverless e-commerce app and easily manage your products

        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Ever have a product or service you think you could sell, but just
          can’t justify hosting fees for a website at the current point in time?
          Say for example, an artist marketplace where product isn’t expected to
          sell daily. With lg-coffee your products exist in their own domain
          completely controlled by you.
        </p>
        <b>Ready to scale?</b>
        <p>
          lg-coffee was designed with scalability in mind from day 1. The entire
          storefront is configured via an JavaScript Object, just add a backend
          of your choosing.
        </p>
        <b>Why should I trust lg-coffee?</b>
        <p>
          Understandably, you should be wary of anything that accepts payment.
          While I'd encourage you to get familiar with the ins and outs of
          lg-coffee, here's a few reasons to feel at ease:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stripe manages all payment intents, product information and order
            details.
          </li>
          <li>
            Storefront is built using Stripe Elements and Next.js. Source code
            includes type checking, strict test cases and has been enforced
            using the Airbnb style guide in collaboration with ESLint and
            Prettier.
          </li>
          <li>Payment intents happen on the backend.</li>
          <li>lg-coffee does not collect information on anyone, ever.</li>
        </ul>
